Notes:
The game is designed one real player and one computer player.
Tried to implement best practices of REST api design
Used version (in URL) for improve the game in the future.
This is only back end part of the game.
If I had more time, I would add db design and DAO implementations, unit test of http request and maybe a simple UI. Also I could add some different types of responses.  In Game.java there is a field roundCount is never used. I would use it to show which round is played to player. For the future, I will review my design and change for multiple player. (But still can be played against the computer), maybe add more feature to the player (id, played games, total point etc.) and really atractive UI:)
